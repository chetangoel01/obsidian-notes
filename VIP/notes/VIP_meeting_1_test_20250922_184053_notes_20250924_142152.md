# VIP Program Meeting Notes

## Introduction

- **Objective**: The meeting outlines the structure and expectations for the VIP (Vertical Integration Program). This program focuses on developing skills in reading, summarizing, and presenting research papers, with an emphasis on applying these skills within the realm of commodities and artificial intelligence (AI).

## Meeting Format and Tools

- **In-Person Meetings**: Encouraged for collaborative problem-solving. Utilize whiteboards for discussion.
- **Weekly Meetings**: Participants are invited to bring questions and topics for collective brainstorming.

## Program Structure

### Paper Summaries and Presentations

1. **Midterm Presentations**:
   - Two presentations, each worth 10% of the final grade.
   - Presentations will be submitted as Google Slides.
   - The focus is on visual and clear communication rather than text-heavy content.

2. **Individual Work**:
   - 70% of the program is based on individual contributions.
   - Each participant is responsible for reading and summarizing papers.
   - Summaries should be concise and well-organized.

3. **Second Phase**:
   - Builds on the first presentation with improvements based on feedback.
   - Emphasizes learning to present as a quant (quantitative analyst).

### Credits and Implementation

- **Credit Options**:
  - 0-credit participants have two options: follow the same path as credit participants or collaborate on a comprehensive review.
  - 1-3 credit participants must implement a research paper and submit a Jupyter Notebook with markdown text and code explanations.

- **Final Project**:
  - Participants will select and implement insights from papers and submit a coherent report or Jupyter Notebook.

### Group Collaboration

- **For 0-Credit Participants**:
  - Collaborate to create a structured review of selected papers.
  - Develop a coherent narrative or taxonomy of the field.
  - Submit a group report worth 30% of the final grade.

## Learning Goals

- **Understanding the Field**: Gain a deep understanding of the commodities and AI landscape.
- **Implementation Skills**: Optional implementation projects for those interested in practical application.
- **Presentation Skills**: Learn to present insights effectively, a crucial skill for quants.

## Additional Points

- **Pass/Fail Criteria**: Emphasizes the importance of participation and contribution to avoid impacting peers negatively.
- **Incentives**: The program structure is designed to motivate consistent effort and learning.

## Action Items

- **Email Summary**: A summary and schedule will be sent via email to all participants.
- **Excel Spreadsheet**: Participants will sign up for paper presentations using a shared Excel spreadsheet.
- **Template for Summaries**: A template for weekly summaries will be provided.

## Conclusion

- **Program Benefits**: Prepares participants for roles in the commodities market, a less crowded field with growing demand for AI expertise.
- **Final Note**: Participants are encouraged to find joy in learning and to engage seriously with the material to gain real understanding.

## Summary

The VIP program is structured to develop critical skills in reading, summarizing, and presenting research papers, with a focus on the commodities sector and its intersection with AI. The program is tailored to individual learning while providing opportunities for collaborative work, especially for those enrolled without credit. Participants are expected to engage deeply with the material, leveraging the program to enhance their professional capabilities in a growing field.

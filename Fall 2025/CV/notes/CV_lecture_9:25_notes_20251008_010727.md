# Lecture Notes: Computer Vision - Lecture 9:25

## Introduction

- The lecture begins with an exploration of microcosm images, focusing on matching techniques in computer vision.
- Key objective: Identify and match cells in different images of the same tissue.
  
## Modeling in Computer Vision

- **Modeling Requirements**: Data, model, and objective function.
- **Data**: The key points in the images.
- **Model**: A framework to relate data points, often using a parametric field to compress and explain the data.
- **Objective Function**: Determines the quality of the model fit by minimizing error.

## Linear Regression Example

- Given a set of data points, a simple model is a linear regression: $y = mx + b$.
- Objective: Find parameters (weights) $w$ that minimize error in the model fit.
- **Gradient Descent**: A method to find the minimum error by iteratively adjusting weights.
  
## Limitations of Least Squares

- Least squares can be skewed by outliers, leading to incorrect model fits.
- Example: A single outlier can significantly increase error due to the squared cost of errors.
  
## RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)

- **Purpose**: Robustly fit models to data by reducing the influence of outliers.
- **Algorithm**:
  1. Randomly sample subsets of data points to define a model.
  2. Count how many data points fit the model within a threshold.
  3. Repeat to probabilistically find the best model.
- **Parameters**:
  - Number of iterations.
  - Subset size for random sampling.
  - Error threshold for determining inliers.

### RANSAC in Practice

- Iteratively samples random points, calculates distance to model, and updates the best model based on inliers.
- Theoretical guarantees on finding the best model based on number of trials and subset size.

## Hough Transform

- **Purpose**: Detect shapes (e.g., lines, circles) in images by converting spatial data into a parameter space.
- **Process**:
  1. Each point votes for potential models (e.g., all lines passing through it in parameter space).
  2. Identify model parameters that receive the most votes.
- **Applications**: Line detection, circle detection, and more complex shapes.

### Circle Detection via Hough Transform

- Parametrization involves the circle's radius and centroid coordinates.
- 3D parameter space (for circles): Two dimensions for the centroid, one for radius.
- Challenges include computational complexity with higher-dimensional data.

## Summary

- **Model Fitting in CV**: Techniques like RANSAC and Hough Transform are essential for robust model fitting in the presence of noise and outliers.
- **Use Cases**: Detecting geometric shapes, matching points across images.
- **Next Lecture**: Discusses high-dimensional representations and transformations, including camera perspectives and image stitching.

## Assignments

- No specific assignments were mentioned, but understanding and practicing RANSAC and Hough Transform implementations are implied tasks.

## Conclusion

This lecture discussed critical techniques in computer vision for model fitting and shape detection, emphasizing robustness against noise and outliers. These methods are foundational for tasks like image recognition, transformation, and analysis in computer vision.


**Bilinear interpolation** is a method to estimate the value of a pixel at **non-integer coordinates** (like (x′,y′)(x', y')(x′,y′)) using the four nearest pixels around it in a 2D grid (the image).

## Key Concepts in Image Processing

### 1. Pixel vs. Patch Operations
- **Pixel Operations**: Basic manipulations applied to single pixels (e.g., brightness adjustments).
- **Patch Operations**: Operations that consider a group of pixels (patches) to derive information, which can aid in noise reduction and feature extraction.

#### 1.1. Defining a Patch
- A **patch** consists of a set of pixels that are within a defined radius from a central pixel.
- **Topology**: Defines how pixels are adjacent (4-cell vs. 8-cell topology).

### 2. Filters and Convolutions
- **Convolution**: A mathematical operation used to apply a filter to an image.
- **Types of Filters**:
  - **Linear Filters**: Output is a linear combination of input values.
  - **Nonlinear Filters**: Values are computed based on operations that are not linear, such as the median filter.

#### 2.1. Median Filtering
- Used to reduce noise (e.g., salt-and-pepper noise) while preserving edges.
- Median filters consider neighboring pixel values and output the median value.

#### 2.2. Padding
- Padding is necessary to ensure that filters can be applied to the edges of images without losing data.

### 3. Edge Detection
- **Edge Detection**: Identifying points in an image where there is a significant change in intensity.
- **Gradient Calculation**: Detecting edges through the calculation of gradients using difference filters.

#### 3.1. Non-Maximum Suppression
- A technique used after edge detection to thin out the edges, retaining only local maxima.

### 4. Connected Components
- **Connected Components Analysis**: A method to detect and label connected regions in binary images (i.e., regions defined by edges).

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Shift Invariance
- Important property of filters where the output remains unchanged regardless of the location of the input signal.

### 2. Linear vs. Nonlinear Filters
- Nonlinear filters (e.g., median filters) can remove outliers effectively, while linear filters may incorporate them into their output.

## Summary of Key Points
- **Filtering**: Central to image processing; involves convolving an input image with a filter to extract features or remove noise.
- **Edge Detection**: Critical for defining object boundaries within images.
- **Connected Components**: Facilitates segmentation and identification of individual objects in an image.

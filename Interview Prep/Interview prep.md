## Weekly Sunday Check-in (30 min)

**Every Sunday:**

1. Review LeetCode progress (how many problems solved?)
2. Did you stick to the 2-hour daily commitment? (Be honest)
3. Which pattern/concept is still confusing?
4. Plan next week's mock schedule
5. Update your "struggled problems" list
6. Celebrate wins (even small ones)

**Adjust if needed:**

- Spending too long on LeetCode? Set strict timers
- System design feels rushed? Swap one React day for extra design
- Need more mocks? Use Saturday flexibly

## Daily Motivation Reminders

**When you don't feel like practicing:**

- "2 hours today beats 0 hours. Just start."
- "Consistency beats intensity over 10 weeks."
- "Every problem you solve is one you might see in an interview."

**When you struggle:**

- "Struggling = learning. This is where growth happens."
- "You have a 3.95 GPA and built production systems. You can do this."
- "Every great engineer has failed problems. Keep going."

**When you're tired:**

- "Take Sunday off if needed. Come back Monday strong."
- "2 hours of focused work > 4 hours distracted."

---

## Red Flags

**You need to adjust if:**

- Missing 3+ days in a row (life happens, but restart ASAP)
- Not retaining patterns (slow down, review more)
- Constant anxiety without improvement (take a rest day)

**You're on track if:**

- Hitting 2 hours daily 6/7 days per week
- Recognizing patterns faster over time
- Mocks showing gradual improvement
- Feeling more confident (even if still nervous)

---

## Final Tips

### The 2-Hour Rule

- **Set a timer.** Start at same time daily if possible (routine helps).
- **No distractions.** Phone away, focused work only.
- **If you miss a day,** don't try to "catch up." Just resume the next day.

### Interview Day Prep

- **Night before:** No studying. Review one system design diagram. Sleep.
- **Morning of:** Light review only (1 problem + key concepts). Eat breakfast. Box breathing.
- **After interview:** Write notes. Don't obsess. Move forward.

### The Long Game

This is a **10-week marathon, not a sprint.** You'll have bad days. That's normal. What matters is showing up consistently. 2 hours a day for 70 days = 140 hours of focused prep. That's enough to transform your interview skills.

**You've got this. Now go build the habit.**

# VizML Lecture 10: Introduction to Black Box Models and Project Guidelines

## Introduction to Final Project

- **Final Project Overview**:
  - Major assignment is the final project.
  - Two options: 
    - Default project (pre-defined problem).
    - Custom project (student-proposed, requires approval).
  - Teams of 2-3 people encouraged; more is expected from teams than individuals.
  - Mentorship available from the instructors or an external mentor.

- **Choosing Between Default and Custom Project**:
  - **Default Project**: 
    - Recommended if you have limited research experience or need guidance.
    - Provides a defined problem with clear goals.
  - **Custom Project**:
    - Suitable for students with specific research interests related to class topics.
    - Requires discussion with instructors for approval.

- **Project Proposal**:
  - Due in a week.
  - Must include a short summary of the project, highlighting the big contribution, potential flaws, and data availability.

- **Project Output**:
  - Expected to deliver a demo, presentation, and a write-up.
  - Write-up should include: Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, Solution, Data, Experiments, Results, and Conclusions.
  - Length should be concise and readable.

- **Examples of Successful Projects**:
  - Image captioning system before LLMs.
  - Sports analytics visualization tool.
  - Fake news visualization tool leading to a startup.

- **Importance of GitHub**:
  - Encouraged to use GitHub for project documentation and showcasing work.
  - Useful for job opportunities, as employers value demonstrated skills and projects.

## Lecture Content: Black Box Models

- **Discussion on PDP, Lime, and Shapley Values**:

  ### Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
  - Used to understand the effect of a feature on predictions while marginalizing over others.
  - Example: Predicting bike rentals based on temperature and other variables.

  ### Lime (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)
  - Provides local explanations by training an interpretable model around a particular prediction.
  - Uses perturbation of inputs and weights from a linear classifier to interpret the model.

  ### Shapley Values
  - Originates from game theory to fairly distribute payouts in cooperative games.
  - Applied to machine learning to determine feature importance.
  - **Shapley Value Calculation**:
    - Considers all permutations of feature additions to calculate marginal contributions.
    - Properties include efficiency, symmetry, and additivity.

- **Challenges with Black Box Models**:
  - Lime's instability due to sensitivity to perturbations.
  - Shapley's computational cost and assumption of feature independence.
  - Correlated features can lead to unreliable interpretations.

## Summary

- **Project Guidelines**:
  - Final project is a significant component of the class.
  - Choose between default and custom projects based on experience and interest.
  - Deliverables include a demo, presentation, and concise write-up.

- **Key Concepts in Black Box Models**:
  - PDP helps understand feature effects globally.
  - Lime offers localized explanations but can be unstable.
  - Shapley values provide a fair distribution of feature importance but require computational resources.

- **Real-World Relevance**:
  - GitHub projects are crucial for job prospects.
  - Black box interpretation techniques are applicable in various domains but should be used with caution.

## Action Items

- **Project Proposal**: Due in a week. Prepare a summary and discuss with instructors if proposing a custom project.
- **Study Recommendations**: Review lecture slides and materials on PDP, Lime, and Shapley values.
- **Next Class**: Focus on deep learning models. Class rescheduled to Tuesday due to fall break.

These notes provide a comprehensive overview of the lecture on project guidelines and black box model interpretation techniques, ensuring students have a clear understanding of expectations and concepts.
